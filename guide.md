# Observing and interviewing people about algorithmic systems
_All the great existing guides on [conducting interviews](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/) and [observations](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/contextual-inquiry/) about systems still applies. Below are some specific tips on researching algorithmic systems in particular_.

---

## Set a goal
What are you trying to learn from this research?

**For algorithmic systems, you might particularly consider:**
- What information (variables) should the algorithm consider?
- What people are likely to likely to break the algorithm's assumptions?
- What might the inadvertant affects be of using this algorithm in this way?
- How might people react to this sytem? 

---

## Select participants
Remember, these questions and methods require a diverse (not necessary huge) group of participants. 

**For algorithmic systems, find people who vary widely in terms of:**
- They goals they have for the system
- The paths they take to reach the system, and what they do afterwards
- How expert they are at navigating this process

---

## Select a location
Conduct your interviews or observations in the place where the algorithm meets human hands. 

**For algorithmic systems, these might be:**
- Their homes or offices, as input data to a website powered by algorithm, or recieve its results (virtually or physically)
- In offices where they handle the consequences of an algorithms' decisions
- In places where they and friends talk about the algorithm's effects

---

## For interviews, set questions

**Ask about:**
- What things they think should affect the algorithm's decision?
- What, in their lives, affects the information that the algorithm uses? How does it change? 
- What happens in their lives after the algorithm makes a decision? What's the sequence of events after each decision?
- How do they feel about the algorithm? How would they describe it?

---
## For observations, decide what to look for

**Look for:**
- How do they interpet what the machine asks for? Are they giving it what it expects?
- How do they interpret any intermediate or final feedback from the machine? Is what it means, and what they understand, the same?
- What happens in their lives after the algorithm makes a decision? What's the sequence of events after each decision?
- What do they think of the algorithm? How would they describe it?

---
## Conduct interviews and observations
**There's nothing special about the practice of conducting interviews and observations about algorithmic systems, over other systems**. If you've picked the right questions, people and goals, you follow advice on how to do good interviews or observations, more generally.

---
## Analyze the results.

**As you review your data from the field, consider these kinds of questions:**
- How do the assumptions of the system (and algorithm) mesh with reality? Does each variable really mean what you think it does?
- What are the "downstream journeys" of people with various system outcomes? Do they seem right? Do they allow for the system's infallibility?
- What metaphors best describe how people think of the system? Is it a friend? A pet? A machine? Is the design driving them to the right metaphor?
